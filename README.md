# Cats are Liquid UI Tweaks
A mod that allows you to customize the UI a bit in [Cats are Liquid - A Better Place](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188080)

**Note: by default the UI will look the same as vanilla,
you need to enable the features manually in the configuration screen (opened using F1) and using customization profiles!**
